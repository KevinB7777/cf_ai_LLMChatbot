# PROMPTS.md

This file documents some of the AI-assisted prompts used during development of **cf_ai_chat**.  
AI assistance was leveraged for brainstorming, debugging, and writing documentation.

## Prompts Used

## Testing
-*"Design curl tests for testing ai feature performance"*

### Debugging
- *"Why is my deploy failing with 'top-level return cannot be used inside an ECMAScript module'?"*
- *“Help me figure out why the Stream button doesn’t show up in my frontend. When I run grep on pages/index.html I can see the <button id="sendStream">Stream</button> line, but when I open the app in my browser through http://[::]:5500/, only the Send button is visible. Why does the Stream button appear only when I open /pages/index.html directly?”*

### Documentation
- *"Draw the file structure of the github repo*
- *"Make a PROMPTS.md file that lists the prompts I used with you."*
